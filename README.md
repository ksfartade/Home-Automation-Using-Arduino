# Working: Different Sensors are used to automate the different home appliances in home. Tilt and Temperator Sensors are combined together to automate and secure the fan performance. Photoregistor is used to automate the light bulb. According to the light intensity we can automate the light buld switch. All this things are controlled using the central controller Arduino Uno. Controller will get the information from the sensors and according the code written it will send the command signals to particular appliances.
